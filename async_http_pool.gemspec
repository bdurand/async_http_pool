  spec.summary = "Generic async HTTP connection pool for Ruby applications using Fiber-based concurrency"
  spec.description = "This gem provides a dedicated async HTTP processor that uses Ruby's Fiber scheduler for non-blocking I/O. Application threads hand off HTTP requests to the processor and return immediately. The processor handles hundreds of concurrent HTTP connections using fibers, then notifies the application when responses arrive via a pluggable callback mechanism. This design keeps application threads free to do other work while HTTP requests are in flight."
