## 1.0.0

### Added

- Async HTTP processor that runs in a dedicated thread with a Fiber-based reactor, allowing hundreds of concurrent HTTP requests without blocking application threads.
- Pluggable `TaskHandler` interface for integrating with any job system or application framework.
- Callback system with `on_complete` and `on_error` handlers for processing HTTP responses and errors.
- `Request` and `RequestTemplate` classes for building HTTP requests with support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- `RequestTemplate` for repeated requests to the same API with shared configuration (base URL, headers, timeouts).
- JSON-serializable `Response` and error objects for safe passing through job queues and across process boundaries.
- Automatic redirect following with configurable maximum redirects.
- HTTP/2 support via the async-http gem.
- Connection pooling with configurable pool size for efficient reuse of connections across hosts.
- External payload storage system with adapters for File, Redis, and S3 to handle large request/response payloads.
- Configurable response size limits to bound memory usage.
- Proxy support for HTTP/HTTPS proxies with authentication.
- Automatic retry support for failed requests.
- Graceful shutdown with configurable timeout and automatic retry of incomplete requests via `TaskHandler#retry`.
- `ProcessorObserver` interface for monitoring processor events (request start/end, errors, capacity exceeded).
- `SynchronousExecutor` for testing without starting the async processor.
- Configurable connection limits, timeouts, response size limits, and User-Agent headers.
- Typed error classes (`HttpError`, `ClientError`, `ServerError`, `RedirectError`, `RequestError`) for precise error handling.
- Optional treatment of non-2xx HTTP responses as errors via `raise_error_responses` configuration.
- `CallbackArgs` for passing custom data through the request/response cycle.
